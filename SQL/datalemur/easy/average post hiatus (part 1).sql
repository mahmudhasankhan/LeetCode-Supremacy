/*
Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021, write a query to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. Output the user and number of the days between each user's first and last post.

p.s. If you've read the Ace the Data Science Interview and liked it, consider writing us a review?

posts Table:

Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
post_id	integer
post_content	text
post_date	timestamp

posts Example Input:

user_id	post_id	post_content	post_date
151652	599415	Need a hug	07/10/2021 12:00:00
661093	624356	Bed. Class 8-12. Work 12-3. Gym 3-5 or 6. Then class 6-10. Another day that's gonna fly by. I miss my girlfriend	07/29/2021 13:00:00
004239	784254	Happy 4th of July!	07/04/2021 11:00:00
661093	442560	Just going to cry myself to sleep after watching Marley and Me.	07/08/2021 14:00:00
151652	111766	I'm so done with covid - need travelling ASAP!	07/12/2021 19:00:00

Example Output:
user_id	days_between
151652	2
661093	21
The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

-- first solution: with just 1 cte and an inner join
with users as (select * from posts where user_id in (SELECT user_id 
FROM posts
where extract(year from post_date) = '2021'
group by user_id
having count(post_id) > 1))

SELECT u1.user_id, EXTRACT(days from  MAX(u1.post_date) - MIN(u2.post_date)) as days_between
FROM users u1
join users u2
on u1.user_id = u2.user_id 
and u1.post_id = u2.post_id
group by u1.user_id
order by u1.user_id

-- second solution: with the use of ctes
with users as (select * from posts where user_id in (SELECT user_id 
FROM posts
where extract(year from post_date) = '2021'
group by user_id
having count(post_id) > 1))

,
first_post as (select user_id, min(post_date) as first_date
from users
GROUP BY user_id)

, last_post as (select user_id, max(post_date) as last_date
from users
GROUP BY user_id)

SELECT fp.user_id, EXTRACT(days from lp.last_date- fp.first_date) as days_between
FROM first_post as fp
JOIN last_post as lp
on fp.user_id = lp.user_id
ORDER BY fp.user_id
